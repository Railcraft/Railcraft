9.6.1.15:
	NEW: Steam Locomotives can now pull fuel and water from attached carts.
	NEW: Rewrote the entire system for moving items and fluids around within Trains. It should be more compatible and less buggy than the previous system.
	INFO: The way the system works is that push and pull requests can only pass through carts that allow them to be passed. For example Chest Carts can pass item requests, but not fluid request. And Tank Carts can pass fluid requests but not item requests.
	INFO: Because of the way the system works, you can either attach a Chest Cart to your Steam Locomotive to supply fuel or a Tank Cart to supply water, but not both. Choices are good.

	NEW: Add Signalling Goggle Aura, a combination of the Tuning and Surveying Aura.
	FIX: Rock Crusher can now crush Entities again.

	FIX: Detector and Directional Detector Track should wait a few ticks before turning off the redstone. Helps prevents pulsing while trains pass over, which often led to glitchy railway logic.
	FIX: Make Receiver Boxes occasionally update their neighbors to prevent situations where the Receiver says one thing and attached blocks another. Could happen when the Receiver was in a different chunk from the adjacent block.
	FIX: Have Block Signals save the last known position of track end positions to NBT. Should prevent Signals from returning Yellow if the chunk on the opposite end isn't loaded. May cause traffic jams and collision if your trains don't have Anchor Carts.
	FIX: Increase the area that Anchor Carts keep chunkloaded from 3x3 chunks to 5x5 chunks in order to help reduce chunkloading derived issues for moving Trains.
	FIX: Boilers and Hobbyist Engines should defer water triggered explosions until their own update tick. Should prevent other mods from crashing when their block randomly disappears mid-update.
	FIX: Disabling any blocks or items used in Rock Crusher recipes should no longer crash. Issue #602
	FIX: Prevent Locking Tracks from reseting in the middle of a Train by searching for nearby carts that are 'almost' on the track.
	FIX: Fix various issues with Signal and Controller/Receiver pairing that could result in dropped links and other random bugs.

6.14.0.21:
	CHANGE: High Speed Explosions are now more impressive and spread flames. I can do this because I'm fairly confident that I finally fixed all of the bugs with HS Track.
	FIX: Completely scrapped the unreliable methods of detecting sudden stops at High Speed in favor of marking tracks as "safe" or "not safe". 
		Safe tracks are HS straight tracks that are connected to other HS Tracks on both ends. This can include unswitched Turnout Switches, but Wye Switches are never "safe".
		Carts will explode if they are moving at HS and encounter a "not safe" track.
	FIX: Fixed a bug in the collision code that could result in random HS Explosions of Trains immediately following a chunk load.
	FIX: Link drag is only applied if the Locomotive Module is active.

	CHANGE: Changed Infernal Brick recipe to be similar to Sandy Brick. Reduces the Soul Sand cost by a 1/5th.

6.14.0.0:
	NEW: Added a means to make Steel if the Blast Furnace is disabled. You need to break an Iron Ingot into Iron Nuggets and cook those in a Furnace to get Steel Nuggets.
	NEW: Added Villager Detector.  *Railcraft Inc. does not condone the enslavement of Villagers for breeding and/or other nefarious purposes.
	NOTE: The Villager Detector currently only works with vanilla Villagers, mod added villagers will be supported in a later update.

	FIX: Rewrote the Multi-Block packet to send fewer bytes per packet.

6.10.0.5:
	FIX: UE integration may be fixed (untested).
	FIX: World Anchors should now properly request new tickets after the ticket has been released.

	FIX: Updated some of the newer MC blocks on the Bore whitelist.

6.10.0.2:
	INFO: This is an extremely experimental release, many things changed under the hood with both Signals and Anchors. I can't promise it won't break existing setups (if it does its a bug that must be fixed before release).
	INFO: More changes are planned to Signal Block pairing and I will be adding a new aura that will let you see how controller/receiver pairing are setup.
	NEW: World Anchors and Anchor Carts now require Ender Pearls to fuel their operation (configurable). One Ender Pearl will by default last for 6 hours. Anchor Carts retain their fuel values when broken.
